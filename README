Licence Agreement
------------------
Do what ever you want with this code.
Use it in your code, change it, delete it.
HOWEVER: Don't blame me if it doesn't work the way it should.

Description.
-----------
Included in this package are:
- the game The Last Eichhof.
- all the needed tools to edit new levels and produce data 
  files needed by the game.
  
Not included:
- graphics & sound & levels of the original game.  
  This is about 6 Meg of data.  
  If you want these you can download it from various FTP sites.
  
Building the game
----------------- 
To build the game you have to use BC++ 3.1 & TASM (version 3 maybe).

Thoughts from the author
------------------------
Most tools won't be useful to you because they are all 
programmed in a hurry. Bad or even not documented at all, 
only I know how to use them. (I hate them too, don't worry).
The game source might be of better use to you. It's fairly good 
(however far from perfect) commented in the source. 
Just have a look at it. I think if you want to learn to 
programm graphics or sound you better have a look at some 
specialized packages not this one. 

Anyway, if you find this package useful send me a mail, 
well even send me a mail if you don't find it useful at all. 
I'm looking forward to hearing from you.
